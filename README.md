# Auto-Climate-Monitoring-System
We are implemented this project using nodemcu and generated a data stores on ThingSpeak server

:)  Problem Solved
Low cost IT solution preferably around the Internet of the Things (IoT) sensor to existing application software. 
The sensor is expected to auto-capture the atmospheric moisture and temperature inside the warehouse.
Based on moisture and temperature data so captured, the software should do appropriate data analytics 
send a timely alert to concern officials of CWC for mitigation and remedial actions arising due to moisture and temperature inside the warehouse. 

:)	OBJECTIVES 
•	Make the current system obsolete. 
•	Reduce human intervention. 
•	Make centralized for the whole Warehouse. 
•	Analysing data based on previous readings. 
•	Real-time display of data.
